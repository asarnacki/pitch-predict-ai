# PitchPredict AI

A web application MVP designed for occasional football fans that leverages AI models to generate percentage-based predictions for match results across Europe's top three football leagues: Premier League, La Liga, and Bundesliga.

## Project Description

PitchPredict AI solves the problem of fragmented football statistics and complex analytical services by providing a simple, free tool that aggregates key data and presents quick, understandable predictions generated by AI models. Users can create accounts, generate predictions, and save them to a personalized "Watched Matches" list for future reference.

The application focuses on delivering one core value: objective, data-based match outcome suggestions presented in a clear, accessible format.
